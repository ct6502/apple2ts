// Algorithm from Kent Dickey (KFest discord, 7/27/2023):
// Keep track of the speaker clicks, let's say you do it in cycles.
// Let's assume you need to create 44.1KHz samples. You remember the cycle
// time of the last sample you've sent to be played (start at 0). Now time
// has passed and you need to generate N more samples. Convert the time of
// the speaker clicks in samples, using 1.020484M cycles per 44100 samples
// (so if the speaker clicked at cycle offset 201, that would be sample
// 8.68. You need to remember if the speaker was high or low, so let's
// assume it was high. Let's assume you have 5 speaker clicks:
// sample 8.1, 8.68, 8.8, and 30.5. Then the audio samples will be:
// [0..7]=HIGH; [8]=(.1+(8.8-8.68))HIGH, [9...29]=LOW, [30]=0.5HIGH, [31...N]=HIGH.
// You calculate the contribution of the time the speaker is high to be the
// multiplier of the high time. Any samples where the speaker didn't toggle
// just repeats the speaker low/high position.
