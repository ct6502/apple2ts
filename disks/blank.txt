Welcome to Applesoft BASIC!

Applesoft BASIC programs consist of lines of code, each starting with a line number. The line numbers determine the order of execution. Here are some basic elements of Applesoft BASIC syntax:

Line Numbers: Each line of code starts with a unique line number.
Variables: Variables can be numeric or string. Numeric variables are used for numbers, and string variables (with a dollar sign $) are used for text.
Commands: Commands perform actions, such as printing text or performing calculations. Commands can be lowercase or uppercase.

Here are some BASIC statements:

PRINT: Displays text or numbers on the screen.
INPUT: Prompts the user to enter data.
GOTO: Jumps to a specified line number.
IF...THEN: Executes a command if a condition is true.
FOR...TO...NEXT: Creates a loop that repeats a block of code.
GOSUB...RETURN: Calls a subroutine and returns to the main program.
REM: Adds a comment to the code.

Sample program:
10 PRINT "Welcome to Applesoft BASIC!"
20 INPUT "What is your name? "; N$
30 PRINT "Hello, "; N$; "!"
40 PRINT "Let's do some math."
50 INPUT "Enter a number: "; A
60 INPUT "Enter another number: "; B
70 C = A + B
80 PRINT "The sum of "; A; " and "; B; " is "; C
90 IF C > 10 THEN PRINT "That's a big number!"
100 FOR I = 1 TO 5
110 PRINT "This is line "; I
120 NEXT I
130 PRINT "Goodbye!"
140 END

Some useful commands at the BASIC prompt:
]-copy2plus     run Copy2Plus
]save myprog    save a BASIC program
]load myprog    load from disk
]run myprog     run from disk
]list
